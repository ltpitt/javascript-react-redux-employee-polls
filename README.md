# Employee Polls

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
It is a web application that allows employees to vote for polls and also create new polls.

## How to install

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

## How to start

Once all dependencies are in stalled you can start the app running:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## How to run tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
